# MAGIC ## Introduction
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this project, we create a distributed ensemble of neural networks that we can train and make predictions with in a distributed fashion, and we also apply this model to the out-of-distribution detection problem [2] (detecting inputs that are highly dissimilar from the training data).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Why ensembles?
# MAGIC Ensembles of neural networks
# MAGIC - often have better predictive performance than single ensemble members [1]
# MAGIC - have shown to provide reliable uncertainty estimates 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The latter quality is beneficial in itself but is especially useful when it comes to tasks such as out-of-distribution detection, where a modelâ€™s uncertainty estimates can be used to determine if a sample is in-distribution or not. We demonstrate this in the experiments below.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Distributed ensembles
# MAGIC In Spark, it is common to distribute *data* over several worker nodes. In this way, the same function is performed on several nodes on different parts of the data. The result from each node is then communicated and aggregated to a final function output. Similarily, we can train a neural network (a single ensemble member) in a distributed way by distributing the data that we use to train it. This can for example be done using the built-in MLP and MLPC classes in Pyspark [3]. However, this approach requires continuous communication between nodes to update model weights (possibly at every iteration) since every node keeps its own version of the model weights. The approach therefore scales badly as
# MAGIC - the number of model parameters grow (more information to communicate between nodes)
# MAGIC - when the complexity of the training algorithm increases, e.g. we wish to use a stochastic training algorithm
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this regard, the communication becomes a bottleneck. Asynchronous updating can reduce the amount of communication, but might also hurt model performance [4].
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Considering that the ensemble members are independent models, they never need to communicate during the training phase. Hence, training ensemble members in a way that requires the otherwise independent training processes to integrate or synchronize, would cause unnecessary costs, for example since the training processes all need to communicate through the driver node. The same holds for prediction; no communication is needed between ensemble members except at the very end when the predictions are aggregated.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To avoid unnecessary communication, we distribute the *ensemble members* and train them on separate worker nodes such that we
# MAGIC - are able to train several ensemble members in parallell (limited by the number of nodes in our cluster) and independently
# MAGIC - avoid communication between worker nodes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To achieve this, we implement our own training processes below. In addition, we implement our own MLP class with the help of PyTorch. MLP objects and their training data are then distributed on worker nodes using Spark. This is not only to avoid distributing the training data over several nodes during training but also to package the ensemble members in a way that makes it possible for us to send them between the driver and the worker nodes prior to and at the end of training.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We introduce the functions that we use to load the data for the experiments that we conduct. We split the available training data between ensemble members using sampling with or without replacement. The number of training data points that we can distribute to each ensemble member is only limited by the memory available to each worker node.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We create a function for generating data consisting of Gaussian clusters. The function takes as input, user defined means and variances for each cluster in the data as well as the total number of observations and a vector of intended class proportions. It also comes with an option to split the final RDD into train and test sets.

# MAGIC Here we have some functions that are used to train/test each individual network in the ensemble. The *Train* function takes the initial weights of a network, trains it on a set of input-taraget data based on stochastic gradient optimization and cross-entropy loss, and returns the state dictionary of the trained network. PyTorch's backpropagation and optimization tools are used to implement this function as usual. The *Predict* function simply takes the state dictionary corresponding to a network as well as a data point (or batch of data), and returns the output (probabilities) of the network at that point.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We now use the class and functions defined above to create an ensemble of feedforward neural networks, and train it in a distributed fashion, where each network is trained on a single worker independently from the other ones. Firstly, several networks are initialized using the MLP class with a random number of hidden layers and neurons, and random initial weights. Using randomness helps to increase the diversity in the ensemble (without which, the outputs of ensemble members could get correlated with each other). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As mentioned before, the training data is partioned into equal size parts, and each of the networks in the ensemble is assigned one part. Since the dataset is assumed to be an RDD (to let it be huge), an iterator object is needed which collects one part of the data RDD (transfers it from the cloud to the driver node) in each call. Note that we here implicitly assume that each part of the data (but not the whole dataset) fits into the memory of a single machine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC After constructing the network object and loading data for each member of the ensemble, the state dictionary of the network and its corresponding training data are packed into a tuple, and appended to a list. The list of state_dict/data tuples is then parallelized to obtain an Spark RDD. We found out that it is difficult to directly put the PyTorch neural network objects in an RDD, apparently becasue Spark does not know by default how to encode these objects and transfer them between nodes. Therefore, we use the state dictionary instead, which contains all the necessary information about a network.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Finally, the network training function (*Train* defined above) is applied to each element of the model/data RDD, in the form of a *map* operation. This tells Spark to run the function on each element in parallel (on worker machines) independently.

# MAGIC # Distributed ensembles prediction API
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC From the training process we get a distributed iterator `models` over the trained models.
# MAGIC (NB. the `train_ensemble` function actually collects the trained models for convenience.)
# MAGIC Internally this is an iterator over `torch.state_dicts` holding the param's of each model respectively.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are different ways in which we can do predictions:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Distributed predictions with `ens_preds(models, test_x)`, which maps the combined model and test data to predictions for each data point.
# MAGIC   This iterator can be collected to a list of the predictions for each ensemble member, or further processed in a distributed and functional manner.
# MAGIC   This is the most flexible variant since it preserves the prediction of every member on every datapoint.
# MAGIC   It is also the most expensive (if we do collect all the data).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Reduced/aggregated predictions with `ens_preds_reduced(models, test_x, red_fn)`. Working with an ensemble, we are often concerned with some aggregate of the members' predictions, eg., the average prediction.
# MAGIC   For this we provide an reducing version of `ens_preds` where the user need only supply the reduce function `red_fn`, describing how to combine the predictions of two ensemble members.
# MAGIC   For instance, if you would like to get the average probability vector of a classifier ensemble for every data point you would use:
# MAGIC   ```python
# MAGIC   avg_prob_vecs = ens_preds_reduced(models, x, lambda x, y: (x+y)/2)
# MAGIC   ```
# MAGIC   Internally, this simply calls `.reduce(red_fn)` on the iterator returned from `ens_preds`. This is merely a convenience function.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Metrics per ensemble member. If the number of test samples is large, we will collect a lot of predictions over the cluster. If we know that we only want an aggregate metric for each member across the whole test data,
# MAGIC   we use the `ens_metrics` method for aggregation on the worker nodes.
# MAGIC   ```python
# MAGIC   avg_acc_per_member = ens_metrics(models, test_input, test_true_labels, <list of metric functions>)
# MAGIC   ```

# MAGIC # Application example: Out of distribution detection
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our distributed ensemble can be used for out of distribution (OOD) detection.
# MAGIC A simple way is to measure the entropy of the combined ensemble prediction; high entropy signals weird data, not seen in the training distribution.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC "Real world" out of distribution data can be hard to come by, but a typical example would be images in different contexts. E.g. scenic vistas or pathology scans may share the same feature space but have very different distribution. For the data we have collected, no such OOD set exists, so we will showcase it with an OOD set of gaussian noise.
# MAGIC Of course, noise that is very far from the in distribution (ID) data will saturate the classifiers softmax for one element, actually yielding very confident, low entropy, nonsense predictions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Regardless, let's see how to do this with the distributed ensemble.
# MAGIC First, we train it and again, save the trained parameters to file
