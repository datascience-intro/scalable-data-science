// MAGIC # What is scalable data science and distributed machine learning?
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Scalability merely refers to the ability of the data science process to scale to massive datasets (popularly known as *big data*). 
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC For this we need *distributed fault-tolerant computing* typically over large clusters of commodity computers -- the core infrastructure in a public cloud today.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC *Distributed Machine Learning* allows the models in the data science process to be scalably trained and extract value from big data.

// MAGIC ### key insights
// MAGIC * Data Science is the study of *the generalizabile extraction of knowledge from data*.
// MAGIC * A common epistemic requirement in assessing whether new knowledge is actionable for decision making is its predictive power, not just its ability to explain the past.
// MAGIC * A *data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning* 
// MAGIC   * mathematics, 
// MAGIC   * machine learning, 
// MAGIC   * artificial intelligence, 
// MAGIC   * statistics, 
// MAGIC   * databases, and 
// MAGIC   * optimization, 
// MAGIC   * along with a deep understanding of the craft of problem formulation to engineer effective solutions.

// MAGIC 
// MAGIC ### key insights
// MAGIC * ML is concerned with the building of computers that improve automatically through experience
// MAGIC * ML lies at the intersection of computer science and statistics and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science
// MAGIC * Recent progress in ML is due to:
// MAGIC   * development of new algorithms and theory
// MAGIC   * ongoing explosion in the availability of online data
// MAGIC   * availability of low-cost computation (*through clusters of commodity hardware in the *cloud* )
// MAGIC * The adoption of data science and ML methods is leading to more evidence-based decision-making across:
// MAGIC   * health sciences (neuroscience research, )
// MAGIC   * manufacturing
// MAGIC   * robotics (autonomous vehicle)
// MAGIC   * vision, speech processing, natural language processing

// MAGIC # Data Engineering
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC There are several views on what a data engineer is supposed to do:
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Some views are rather narrow and emphasise division of labour between data engineers and data scientists:
// MAGIC  
// MAGIC - https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition
// MAGIC   - Let's check out what skills a data engineer is expected to have according to the link above.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC > "Ian Buss, principal solutions architect at Cloudera, notes that data scientists focus on finding new insights from a data set, while data engineers are concerned with the production readiness of that data and all that comes with it: formats, scaling, resilience, security, and more."
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC > What skills do data engineers need?
// MAGIC > Those “10-30 different big data technologies” Anderson references in “Data engineers vs. data scientists” can fall under numerous areas, such as file formats, > ingestion engines, stream processing, batch processing, batch SQL, data storage, cluster management, transaction databases, web frameworks, data visualizations, and machine learning. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC > Buss says data engineers should have the following skills and knowledge:
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC > - They need to know Linux and they should be comfortable using the command line.
// MAGIC > - They should have experience programming in at least Python or Scala/Java.
// MAGIC > - They need to know SQL.
// MAGIC > - They need some understanding of distributed systems in general and how they are different from traditional storage and processing systems.
// MAGIC > - They need a deep understanding of the ecosystem, including ingestion (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis), processing frameworks (e.g. Spark, Flink) and storage engines (e.g. S3, HDFS, HBase, Kudu). They should know the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and what it's best used for.
// MAGIC > - They need to know how to access and process data.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Let's dive deeper into such highly compartmentalised views of data engineers and data scientists and the so-called "machine learning engineers" according the following view:

// MAGIC # The Data Engineering Scientist as "The Middle Way"
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Here are some basic axioms that should be self-evident.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC - Yes, there are differences in skillsets across humans
// MAGIC   - some humans will be better and have inclinations for engineering and others for pure mathematics by nature and nurture
// MAGIC   - one human cannot easily be a master of everything needed for innovating a new data-based product or service (very very rarely)
// MAGIC - Skills can be gained by any human who wants to learn to the extent s/he is able to expend time, energy, etc.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC For the **Scalable Data Engineering Science Process:** *towards Production-Ready and Productisable Prototyping for the Data Factory* we need to allow each data engineer to be more of a data scientist and each data scientist to be more of a data engineer, up to each individual's *comfort zones* in technical and mathematical/conceptual and time-availability planes, but with some **minimal expectations** of mutual appreciation.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC This course is designed to help you take the first minimal steps towards **data engineering science**.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC In the sequel it will become apparent **why a team of data engineering scientists** with skills across the conventional (2019) spectrum of data engineer versus data scientist  **is crucial** for **Production-Ready and Productisable Prototyping for the Data Factory**.
