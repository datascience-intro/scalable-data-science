I have scheduled to post specific notebooks (some of them with video from 2017, 2018, 2019) to help each group more specifically (please let me know if I said I would do something more but forgot):

    those parsing xml in general for any group-project,
    those tasked with distributed vertex programs for TDA (pointers to papers and rat brain network data... via GitHub pushes)
    doing LDA (with another notebook on Cornell movie dialogs that shows how to parse input data in non-standard formats)
    sentiment analysis with tweets or any text inputs in Swedish language (Swedish lexicon for sentiments plus emotion score mapper),plus custom track-and-follow for Wallenberg network of companies world-wide
    add NASA airtraffic data over Atlanta Georgia for the group interested in sketching quantiles with more notebooks for sketches and t-digest with structured streaming flat-map-groups-with-states example in action on t-digest (this already works in Spark 2.0, but not in 10x more efficient version in spark 3.0)
    perhaps making sure sds-2-x-dl notebooks work in the special version 2 spark cluster for the group analysis data from the Hadron collider...
